# ClawLens

> Real-time observability dashboard for AI agents. The Grafana for your personal AI.

## What is ClawLens?

ClawLens is a free, open-source observability dashboard purpose-built for AI agents running on OpenClaw. It gives you real-time visibility into what your AI agents are actually doing: token usage, costs, sub-agent activity, cron jobs, memory file changes, and session history.

## Key Facts

- **License:** MIT (free and open source)
- **Install:** `pip install clawlens` then `clawlens`
- **Website:** https://clawlens.com
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/vivekchand/clawlens
- **PyPI:** https://pypi.org/project/clawlens/
- **Author:** Vivek Chand
- **Category:** Developer Tools, AI/ML Ops, Observability
- **Platforms:** macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL), Raspberry Pi
- **Requirements:** Python 3.8+, Flask
- **Setup time:** 30 seconds

## Features

- **Live Flow Visualization:** Animated SVG showing data flow from user → channels → gateway → brain → tools → infrastructure, updating in real-time
- **Token & Cost Tracking:** Per-session, per-model, per-tool cost breakdown with bar charts and daily/weekly/monthly totals
- **Sub-Agent Monitoring:** See every sub-agent's files, commands, tools, thinking process, and status in real-time
- **Cron Job Dashboard:** Scheduled jobs with status, schedule, last/next run, duration, failure alerts
- **Session History:** Timeline of all sessions with model, channel, token usage, and last activity
- **Memory File Browser:** View and track changes to SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, daily notes
- **Transcript Viewer:** Chat-bubble UI with color-coded roles for reviewing conversations
- **System Health:** Service uptime, disk usage, active sub-agents at a glance
- **Mission Control Integration:** Hooks into OpenClaw's task system
- **Built-in OpenTelemetry Collector:** Real token counts and actual cost tracking
- **Dark and Light Themes**

## How It Compares

ClawLens is specifically designed for AI agent observability, unlike general-purpose tools:
- **vs Grafana:** ClawLens requires zero config, understands AI agent concepts (tokens, sub-agents, sessions) natively
- **vs Datadog:** Free, self-hosted, no data leaves your machine
- **vs LangSmith:** Works at the agent infrastructure level, not just LLM calls
- **vs Custom dashboards:** One pip install, no YAML, no Docker compose needed

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install clawlens
clawlens
# Opens at http://localhost:8900
```

## Use Cases

- Monitor AI agent token spending before the invoice arrives
- Debug sub-agent behavior by watching real-time activity
- Track cron job health and catch failures early
- Review session transcripts for quality assurance
- Visualize the architecture of multi-agent systems

## Technical Details

- Single Python file, minimal dependencies (Flask)
- Auto-detects OpenClaw workspace
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time updates
- REST API for programmatic access
- Embeddable in existing workflows
